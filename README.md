I couldn't imagine I would easily go through learning html tags and commands; the main outcome is that any web page has a head and body which include any type of content <p> paragraph <img> pictures with different type of source src either a permanent link using https://... or the path within the working directory
Highlighting either using Bold <strong> or Itallic <em>
Using ancors to include links between web pages <a> with href to provide likewise pictures, different methods permanent link or a html file in the working directory
